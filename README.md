Step 1
Remove the dist directory from the project’s .gitignore file (already done).

Step 2
Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).

git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
Step 3
Use subtree push to send it to the gh-pages branch on GitHub.

git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
Boom. If your folder isn’t called dist, then you’ll need to change that in each of the commands above.
